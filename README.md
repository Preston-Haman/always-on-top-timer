# always-on-top-timer
An Always-On-Top Timer application written in Java with Swing.

# What is it?
This was one of my first projects after taking a couple quarters of Java at a local college.
At the time, I was using a similar application that I found online; but, that one didn't quite suit my needs.
I created this application as a way to practice my newfound skillset and produce a better timer application for myself.
Some of its features, such as the position on-screen when it opens, are tailored specifically to my use.

I returned to this project, briefly, to refactor it and add it to GitHub; however, my other studies caused this project to take a back seat.
I've not decided if I will return to this project again, or not.

## Features
At the moment, there are three types of timer included with this application.
- There's the basic Stopwatch mode, which counts up from zero.
- There's a Countdown mode, which counts down to zero from a user-specified starting time.
- And, lastly, there's an Interval mode, which counts down to zero from a list of user-specified starting times (looping when done).

The following is an image of various GUI elements of the application for the Interval mode:
